Project Overview 

- The Quantitative Research Portfolio project establishes a reproducible, end-to-end framework for systematic financial data analysis and strategy development. It begins with setting up a robust Python environment and GitHub repository, then builds a high-quality data pipeline using public APIs. The project proceeds to ingest, validate, and store historical market data before layering exploratory analysis, model prototyping, and backtesting modules. Ultimately, it will culminate in polished Jupyter notebooks and Streamlit dashboards that showcase data-driven insights and candidate strategies—serving as both a hands-on learning tool and a professional showcase for systematic asset management roles.

Project Objectives:

Reproducible Environment
- Establish a self-contained Conda environment (quant_env) with all dependencies tracked via environment.yml and requirements.txt, ensuring others can reproduce analyses seamlessly.

Professional Repository Structure
- Implement a clear, modular GitHub repository layout—separating raw/processed data, source code, notebooks, and tests—to demonstrate best practices in version control and project organization.

Robust Data Pipeline
- Research and validate public market data APIs (e.g., yfinance, pandas-datareader) to create a resilient ingest module (src/data_ingestion.py) with retry logic, logging, and data-quality checks, capable of batch processing 50+ tickers.

Data Validation & Documentation
- Define and document a data dictionary, file naming conventions, and schema for raw vs. processed data; include automated validation routines to ensure completeness and integrity across time series.

Exploratory Analysis & Prototyping
- Develop Jupyter notebooks that perform initial EDA, visualize key market metrics (OHLCV, returns distributions), and prototype simple factor models, laying the groundwork for systematic strategy research.

Portfolio-Ready Deliverables
- Produce polished artifacts—clean notebooks, sample backtests, and an interactive dashboard—demonstrating technical proficiency and clear communication, ready for inclusion in an online portfolio and discussion during interviews.

Scalability & Maintainability
- Use modular code patterns, unit tests, and configuration files to ensure the project can be extended to new data sources, additional asset classes, and more sophisticated strategies as skills grow.
